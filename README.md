> Hot hot hot dotfile management

<!-- #### Installation

```sh
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cfeusier/.ctf/master/.bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

This will nuke the following files: `.aliases, .zshrc, .bashrc, .bash_profile, .vimrc, .tmux.conf, .gitignore, and .gitconfig`, so make sure you have a backup of whichever you would like to keep.

The installation script will set up your environment by creating symbolic links between files in `.env` and the correct dotfiles at the system-level.

#### Management

Edit your dotfiles in `.env`, and then use `ctf` just like `git`, to add, commit, and push to your remote repository. Once ready, rerun install script to setup your enviroment with new changes.
