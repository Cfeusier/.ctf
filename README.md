## .ctf

> Hot AF dotfile management

#### Installation

```sh
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cfeusier/.ctf/master/.bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

This will nuke the following files: `.aliases, .zshrc, .bashrc, .bash_profile, .vimrc, .tmux.conf, .gitignore, and .gitconfig`, so make sure you have a backup of whichever you would like to keep.
